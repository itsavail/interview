  "synopsis": "The story of Tress unfolds on a desolate island known as Diggen's Point or the Rock, where Tress, a pragmatic young girl, lives. She is known for her wild hair and her penchant for collecting cups. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she falls in love with Charlie, the son of the Duke who disguises himself as the groundskeeper of his father's mansion. Their happiness is short-lived when Charlie is sent away to be presented for betrothal to various princesses. He promises to remain unmarried and return to Tress, sending her cups from each kingdom he visits as proof of his bachelorhood. However, when the cups stop coming, Tress learns that Charlie has been sent on a dangerous mission to marry a Sorceress who frequently raids the borders of their kingdom. The Duke and King view this as a win-win situation: either Charlie succeeds and neutralizes a threat or dies and they are rid of an unwanted heir. Determined to save Charlie, Tress embarks on an adventure that takes her from her home island to the high seas. Tress's journey begins with devising an escape plan from the Rock which is heavily regulated by government officials. With help from three men who owe favors to her father Lem, she manages to leave the island disguised as a cargo inspector aboard a ship called Oot's Dream. However, she soon finds herself captured by smugglers after their ship attacks Oot's Dream. Despite being captured, Tress manages to prove her worth by scrubbing the deck of their ship called Crow's Song and earns herself a place among them. During her time aboard Crow’s Song, she learns about its hierarchy and discovers that its cannonballs are rigged to sink ships - something that most crew members are unaware of. Tress also discovers dangerous midnight spores while aboard Crow’s Song which she decides to keep for future use. She uses these spores to create a rat-like creature that she uses to spy on the crew and gather more information about their captain, Crow's intentions. She also learns about a being named Xisis who has the power to cure any disease and realizes that Crow wants to find Xisis to cure her of her spore infestation. As Tress continues her journey, she manages to convince Crow to sail the Crimson Sea, a dangerous journey but one that might lead them to Xisis. However, she soon realizes that Crow plans to trade her to Xisis as a servant in exchange for her healing. Despite this realization, Tress decides to stay on the ship and help the crew while also finding a way to save Charlie. Tress's plan involves creating flares that release verdant aether, a type of spore upon impact. She uses these flares during a storm lifting their ship above the storm's spikes and saving the crew. This act earns her the crew's love and loyalty which threatens Crow's authority. Despite being hailed as a hero, Tress finds herself in danger when Crow forces her into meeting with Xisis. In an unexpected turn of events, Tress convinces Xisis to take Crow as his servant instead of her arguing that Crow is more valuable. Upon returning back to the ship, Tress is hailed as a hero once again. The final leg of Tress’s journey takes her towards the Sorceress’s island where she hopes to rescue Charlie who has been turned into a rat by the Sorceress. Despite being captured by creatures made of Midnight Essence controlled by the Sorceress upon reaching the island, Tress manages to confront the Sorceress and demands that she leave their world. In an unexpected twist, it is revealed that Charlie can only be turned back into human if he brings Tress back to be cursed by the Sorceress. However, Tress declares her love for Charlie and her willingness to be with him regardless of the curse. The Sorceress, realizing that she may not win against Tress and her crew, agrees to leave. The story ends with Tress and Charlie, now human again, setting sail on new adventures aboard their new ship, the Two Cups. They are joined by their loyal crew who have proven that they are capable of overcoming any obstacle.",
