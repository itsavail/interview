# AvailMini starter Rails app 

This is a bootstrapped Rails app from the [Rails generator](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html) with the scaffolding for Coverage Reports having been generated.

## Running commands

Start every command with `bundle exec` so that it runs in the context of the installed gems environment. The console pane will give you output from the server but you can run arbitrary commands from the shell without stopping the server.

## Database

SQLite would work in development but we don't recommend running it in production. Otherwise you are welcome to connect databases from your favorite provider.
