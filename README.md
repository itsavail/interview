# Avail by Zestworld Engineering Take Home

## About the team & role

Avail is the AI platform for Hollywood. We’re starting with creative development executives and reshaping the workflow of how IP starts from an idea to becoming the final TV & Films you love. Our team of 5 comes from Amazon AWS, Google, and Spotify.

We’re looking for curiosity-driven software engineers excited to build collaborative at an early stage startup, bringing technology innovation to entertainment professionals. Our engineering team operates mostly full-stack, integrating new AI technologies and front-end development, and we want to continue expanding with growth-minded, self-driven individuals.

## The interview challenges

As part of the hiring process, we use a take home exercise that's fun, interesting, and provides our team with better insights about candidates. Most real-world development work requires solving semi-specific problems in semi-constrained timeframes with access to external resources. We want our assignment to reflect the same scenarios & use the same expectations that we follow ourselves. We hope that by providing simple requirements with semi-openended scope allows individuals the autonomy to uniquely craft their own solution while still delivering on the overall goal.

What we look for in the output:

- It works - we want to be able to see a demo and review the submission with you
- Code quality - is it stable, reliable, and organized appropriately
- Design trade-offs - we want to understand the decisions you made and why
