# Avail by Zestworld Engineering take home interview

## About the team & role

Avail is the AI platform for Hollywood. We’re starting with creative development executives and reshaping the workflow of how IP starts from an idea to becoming the final TV & Films you love. Our team of 5 comes from Amazon AWS, Google, and Spotify.

We’re looking for curiosity-driven software engineers excited to build collaborative at an early stage startup, bringing technology innovation to entertainment professionals. Our engineering team operates mostly full-stack, integrating new AI technologies and front-end development, and we want to continue expanding with growth-minded, self-driven individuals.

## The interview challenges

As part of the hiring process, we use a take home exercise that's fun, interesting, and provides our team with better insight. Most development work requires solving semi-specific in semi-constrained timeframe with external resources, we want to mimic the expectations we follow ourselves by providing candidates with semi-broad scope and some requirements but the autonomy to uniquely craft their own solution and deliver it.

What we look for in the output:

- It works - we want to be able to see a demo and review the submission with you
- Code quality - is it stable, reliable, and organized appropriately
- Design trade-offs - we want to understand the decisions you made and why
