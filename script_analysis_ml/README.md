# Machine Learning Engineer Assignment Overview

As part of the hiring process, we use a take home exercise that's fun, interesting, and provides our team with better insight. Most development work requires solving semi-specific in semi-constrained timeframe with external resources, we want to mimic the expectations we follow ourselves by providing candidates with semi-broad scope and some requirements but the autonomy to uniquely craft their own solution and deliver it.

What we look for in the output:

- It works - we want to be able to see a demo and review the submission with you
- Code quality - is it stable, reliable, and organized appropriately
- Design trade-offs - we want to understand the decisions you made and why

## The Challenge: Movie Script & Performance Case Study

This assignment is designed to test your ability to build a tangible feature with a semi-contrained, semi-openended prompt. There's a range of considerations, including data processing, data analysis, machine learning, and evaluating trade-offs.

Given a raw dataset of movie performance data, you are tasked with analyzing the data and generating specific recommendations on how the business can improve. The dataset contains information on movie performance, including revenue, budget, and other relevant information. Additionally, a dataset with script text files is provided. The goal is to analyze the data and propose recommendations on how the data can be utilized to add new features to Coverage Report generation for new scripts. Provide any supporting analysis and state your assumptions in your work.

## Deliverables

1. Instructions on how to access & download the code for your submission
2. A link to the live demo or the app running locally for a walkthrough call
3. Be prepared to discuss explanations of the design trade-offs you made
4. Bonus sections are not required, if you have time and want extend the assignment, feel free to implement them

### **Main Focus: Data Processing & Feature Analysis**

Given the raw dataset of movie performance data and script text files, you are tasked with processing the data and evaluating the attributes/features. You should transform and analyze both datasets to identify any patterns or relationships that might be insightful.

You are free to use any tools or libraries you see fit to manipulate, clean, and analyze the data. Be prepared to show your work and explain your process in the case where there's no clear UI/output.

### **Improvement: Prediction API**

After analyzing the data, you should propose a model that will predict the performance of a movie based on the script text. You should provide a simple API that takes in a script text and returns a prediction of the movie's performance. You are free to use any model or approach you see fit, but be prepared to explain your choice and the trade-offs you made.

### **Bonus: Explanation API [Extra Credit]**

In addition to the prediction API, you should provide an API that explains the prediction. The API should take in a script text and return an explanation of the prediction. The explanation should be human-readable and provide insights into why the model made the prediction it did. You are free to use any approach you see fit, but be prepared to explain your choice and the trade-offs you made.

### **Bonus: Optimization of Data Pipeline [Extra Credit]**

Given the raw dataset of movie performance data and script text files, you should optimize the data pipeline to improve the performance of the prediction API. You should consider the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the speed of the prediction. Depending on your application, make design trade-offs to optimize the data pipeline and improve the overall user experience.
